# Hub and Spoke Network Topology - Organized Layout

## Overview
Created a hub-and-spoke network topology similar to the screenshot, with ESW1 (192.168.111.198) as the central hub connecting to multiple devices in an organized layout.

## Hub and Spoke Layout

  - Icon: üåê

#### Bottom Row - Access Switches:
- **ESW2** (192.168.10.1) - Access Switch 1
  - Position: Bottom left (200, 450)
  - Color: Green
  - Icon: üîå

- **ESW3** (192.168.20.1) - Access Switch 2
  - Position: Bottom right (600, 450)
  - Color: Green
  - Icon: üîå

## Visual Organization

### 1. **Hub and Spoke Design**
- ESW1 (real device) at the center
- All other devices connected directly to the central hub
- Clean, organized layout similar to the screenshot
- Professional network diagram appearance

### 2. **Connection Lines**
- All devices connected to central ESW1 with blue lines
- Clean, straight lines from center to each device
- No crossing or messy connections
- Professional appearance

### 3. **Device Positioning**
- **Top Row**: Internet/External services (ISPs, Cloud)
- **Middle Row**: Security and routing (Firewall, Router)
- **Bottom Row**: Access switches
- **Center**: Real ESW1 switch (hub)

### 4. **Color Coding**
- **Blue**: Real device (ESW1)
- **Purple**: ISP devices
- **Cyan**: Cloud services
- **Orange**: FortiGate firewall
- **Red**: Router
- **Green**: Demo switches

## Layout Structure
```
    ISP-1    ISP-2    Cloud-1
      |        |        |
      |        |        |
  FGT-100D  ESW1    RTR-1
      |   (Real)     |
      |        |        |
    ESW2       |      ESW3
```

## Benefits

## Files Modified
- `src/components/Topology.js` - Hub and spoke layout
- `src/components/Topology.js.backup` - Original version preserved

## How to Revert
To restore the previous version:
```bash
cp src/components/Topology.js.backup src/components/Topology.js
```

## Error Fixes
- Fixed any configuration errors
- Ensured real device functionality
- Clean, organized layout
- Professional appearance

The topology now has a clean, organized hub-and-spoke layout similar to your screenshot, with ESW1 (192.168.111.198) as the central hub connecting to all other devices!
