## Problem Solved
Removed all connection lines completely to eliminate messy links and create a clean, simple device layout.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed All Connection Lines**
- **Before**: Messy SVG lines connecting devices
- **After**: No connection lines at all
- Clean, simple device layout

### 2. **Clean Device Positioning**
- **Router (RTR-1)**: Top center (400, 200)
- **FortiGate (FGT-100D)**: Top right (600, 200)
- **ESW1 (Real)**: Bottom center (400, 350)
- **ESW2 (Demo)**: Bottom left (200, 350)

### 3. **Simplified Layout**
- No SVG elements for connections
- No messy lines or visual clutter
- Focus on individual devices only
- Clean, professional appearance

## Device Layout

### Top Row:
- **RTR-1** (Router) - Center top
- **FGT-100D** (FortiGate) - Top right

### Bottom Row:
- **ESW2** (Demo Switch) - Bottom left
- **ESW1** (Real Switch) - Bottom center

## Visual Features

### 1. **Clean Design**
- No connection lines or visual clutter
- Focus on individual devices
- Professional, minimalist appearance
- Easy to see each device clearly

### 2. **Device Cards**
- Large, clear device cards (100x100px)
- Color-coded by device type
- Hover effects for interactivity
- Clear device information

### 3. **Color Coding**
- **Blue**: Real device (ESW1)
- **Red**: Router (RTR-1)
- **Orange**: FortiGate (FGT-100D)
- **Green**: Demo switch (ESW2)

### 4. **Interactive Elements**
- Click any device to open terminal
- Hover effects (scale up on hover)
- Real device indicator (green dot)
- Tooltips with device information

## Files Modified
- `src/components/Topology.js` - Removed all connection lines
- `src/components/Topology.js.backup` - Original version preserved

## How to Revert
To restore the previous version with links:
```bash
cp src/components/Topology.js.backup src/components/Topology.js
```

## Summary
The topology now has a clean, simple layout with just the devices and no connection lines. This eliminates all the messy link issues and creates a professional, easy-to-understand network diagram perfect for demonstrations.

## Device Information
- **ESW1** (192.168.111.198) - Real working switch (Blue with green dot)
- **RTR-1** (10.0.0.1) - Demo router (Red)
- **FGT-100D** (172.16.1.1) - Demo FortiGate (Orange)
- **ESW2** (192.168.1.1) - Demo switch (Green)

All devices are clickable and open terminals for interaction, with the real ESW1 maintaining full SSH functionality.
